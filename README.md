 -  When the Generate Password button is selected, the user is asked to select the length of the password between 8 and 128 characters and what type of characters to include. When the user has made their selections a password is generated and displayed in the text area labeled  Your Secure Password. The user can then copy and use the password. 

 - During the short time I’ve been in the boot camp, I have gained proficiency in the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs. Despite being new to this field, and still learning, I am doing my best to apply the skills I have acquired to the exercises, projects, and homework assignments.

Although I am still learning in this fast paced class, I hope to have my projects stand out by their creativity and use of tools we learned throughout the Boot Camp, resulting in well crafted and professional designs.

I have used these tools and resources to further the growth of this project.
